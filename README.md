## Who This Book Is For ? 
This book is not an introduction to machine learning. If you are not comfortable with the basic concepts of machine learning or have never spent time learning machine learning, do not buy this book. Instead, this book is for the machine learning practi‚Äê tioner who, while comfortable with the theory and concepts of machine learning, would benefit from a quick reference containing code to solve challenges he runs into working on machine learning on an everyday basis. This book assumes the reader is comfortable with the Python programming language and package management.
## Who This Book Is Not For ? 
As stated previously, this book is not an introduction to machine learning. This book should not be your first. If you are unfamiliar with concepts like cross-validation, random forest, and gradient descent, you will likely not benefit from this book as much as one of the many high-quality texts specifically designed to introduce you to the topic. I recommend reading one of those books and then coming back to this book to learn working, practical solutions for machine learning.
